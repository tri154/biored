# BioRED Relation Extraction (BioRED-RE)

-----

This repository provides the PubMedBERT version source code of our paper [BioRED: A Rich Biomedical Relation Extraction Dataset]. For the BERT-GT version, you can find it at [BERT-GT](https://github.com/ncbi/bert_gt)

## Environment:

* GPU: NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2
* Python: python3.9

## Set up:

```
conda create -n biored_re python=3.9
conda activate biored_re
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 1:

Because generating the input datasets is trivial (we have to install the scispacy), we provide our dataset_format_converter, and you can use it to convert the BioRED dataset into the input dataset of BioRED-RE.

### Download and generate the BioRED dataset for BioRED-RE
```
bash scripts/build_biored_dataset.sh
```

## Step 2:

BioRED-RE used [PubMedBERT]'s [pre-trained model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract) because they support longer text (with 512 sequence length).

After downloading the model, please put the model (microsoft folder) in biored-re/.

## Step 3: Running on the BioRED dataset

```
bash run_biored_exp.sh <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES>
```

Please replace the above <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES> with your GPUs' IDs. Eg: '0,1' for GPU devices 0 and 1.
For example

```
bash run_biored_exp.sh 0,1
```

After finished, you should have below files:
* biored_pred_mul.txt: the prediction file in pubtator format.
* biored_mul_score.txt: the multi-class relation performance (in Table 6 of our paper).
* biored_mul_novelty_score.txt: the multi-class relation + novelty performance (in Table 6 of our paper).
* biored_bin_score.txt: the binary relation performance (in Table 6 of our paper).
* biored_bin_novelty_score.txt: the binary relation + novelty performance.

## Predicting New Data:

If you only wish to use our tool for predicting new data without the need for training, please follow the steps outlined below:

Download the [biored_re_model.tar](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioRED/biored_re_model.tar) file and place it in the "biored-re/" directory.

Open the "scripts/run_test_pred.sh" file and modify the values of the variables "in_pubtator_file" and "out_pubtator_file" to match your input PubTator file (with annotations) and the desired output PubTator file (where predicted relations will be stored).

Execute the following script to initiate the prediction process:

```
bash scripts/run_test_pred.sh <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES>
```

Please replace the above <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES> with your GPUs' IDs. Eg: '0,1' for GPU devices 0 and 1.
For example

```
bash scripts/run_test_pred.sh 0,1
```
